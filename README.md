# Reflow-oven-controller-

**What the Project is about:**
This project presents the Reflow Oven Controller, a sophisticated device engineered to precisely regulate the temperature of a conventional toaster oven via a solid-state relay. Programmed in assembly language, our controller boasts the capability to monitor temperatures ranging from 25°C to 240°C using a K-type thermocouple with cold junction compensation. Equipped with a user-friendly interface, it enables users to select reflow profile parameters and provides real-time displays of temperature, running time, and current reflow process status. Utilizing Pulse Coded Modulation (PCM) in conjunction with a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC), the device offers audible temperature feedback every 5 seconds, along with indications of the reflow process status.

**What the report contains:**
The report summarizes the project's progress during a month-long working period, detailing the final results, source code, diagrams depicting the initial and final designs, and thorough calculations performed throughout the project. 

**My role in the project:**
As a member of a dynamic six-person team, I played a pivotal role in the collaborative design and programming of a sophisticated reflow oven controller, leveraging the capabilities of the AT89LP51RC2 microprocessor. Below a short summary of the parts I have worked on is described with what I have achieved at the end. 

**Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) Implementation:** I spearheaded the successful integration of Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) techniques to achieve precise control over the oven's power output. This enabled us to maintain optimal temperature profiles during the reflow process, ensuring consistent and high-quality results.

**Interactive LCD Interface Development:** My focus extended to developing an intuitive LCD interface that facilitated real-time temperature monitoring and enabled users to make precise adjustments throughout the reflow process. This interactive interface significantly enhanced the user experience and simplified the management of complex temperature profiles.

**Integration of Voice Feedback:** One of the standout features of our reflow oven controller was the integration of voice feedback for temperature readings. I led the effort to incorporate this functionality, which not only enhanced user interaction but also provided valuable auditory cues for process monitoring, further augmenting the usability and accessibility of our system.

**What I learned:**
Participating in the reflow oven controller project sharpened my troubleshooting skills by tackling intricate technical challenges collaboratively. Engaging with diagnostic tools like oscilloscopes, I refined my ability to diagnose and resolve complex circuit issues efficiently, underscoring the importance of meticulous attention to detail in problem-solving.
